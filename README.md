The samples of works are published on my demo page.

The first point of the menu is called browser games and consists of two examples.
There are two games (a space shooter and a wandering eye) there. In the space shooter a spacecraft is tied to the mouse cursor and moves around the field. When you click the left mouse button, it shoots blue fireballs at asteroids. When hitting the asteroids blow up. Those asteroids are the elements of an array and each of them is assigned random coordinates along the x-axis. One life is lost when the biggest asteroid hits a ship. The game is over when three lives are lost.

A wandering eye is a small blank that can be used when creating a browser game. The eye moves using the arrow keys. It moves a fixed distance. To make it clear, the field is made in the form of chess cells. If there is a drop of water in the cell when the eye gets there, the points increase by 1. If there is a thorn in the cell when the eye gets there, the points decrease by 1. All drops and thorns fall from the top along fixed paths at different speeds.

The second point of the menu consists of two pages with adaptive versions. These pages were created using HTML, CSS and media queries.

The third point of the menu consists of a game called knight's move and a calculator. As for the game the field is a chessboard there. If you click on any square on the chessboard then all possible knight's moves from that square are highlighted. The backlight lasts 1.5 seconds.
When creating the calculator I used JavaScript math functions and also the <table> tag (in creation the keyboard).
